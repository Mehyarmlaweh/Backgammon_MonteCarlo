# Backgammon_MonteCarlo
This project aims to analyze the Backgammon game using two different search algorithms: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Monte Carlo Search (MC). The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of their ability to find optimal moves and the time they take to do so.
